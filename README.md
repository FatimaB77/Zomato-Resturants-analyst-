# ZOMATO project 
The Zomato Revenue Analysis involved analyzing top restaurant and customer data to gain insights into total revenue and restaurant's popularity. I conducted an in-depth analysis of sales data and identifying total revenue by location, Cuisine and customer rating. Using Tableau, I created a comprehensive dashboard and report. The findings offered strategic recommendations to optimize restaurant performance, enhance customer engagement, and improve operational efficiency.The Dashboard includes Key performance indicators such
as total revenue, total number of orders, average total sales by city,
Restaurant total sales quantity yearly, user rating and cuisines affects
on sale. This summery will provide insight into the visualizations
presented on the Dashboard.
